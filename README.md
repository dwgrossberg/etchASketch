# etchASketch
An interactive Etch-a-Sketch built with vanilla JavaScript

This simple game allows users to draw on a sketchpad by clicking their mouse and moving it across the screen. Users can specify the size of their sketchpad pixels, as well as pixel color through a customizable color picker. In addition there is a button that will set each pixel to a random rbg color, an eraser, and a toggle shade button that darkens each pixel by an increment of 10%.

Built as part of The Odin Project, 2022.
